## Research Interests

+ **Vehicle Network Security**: Research on vulnerabilities in in-vehicle communication protocols (e.g., CAN networks) and bus-off attacks.
+ **Kernel and Network Security**: Development and analysis of 5G transparent proxy implementations and Linux kernel modules.
+ **Cognitive Neuroscience**: Exploration of interdisciplinary research bridging mathematics and neuroscience.
+ **Cryptography**: Focus on concepts such as RSA, ECC, and the algebraic foundations of encryption.
+ **Cybersecurity**: Practical experience and interest in cryptographic, pwn, and forensic challenges; participation in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.

## About Me 
My academic journey began at National Central University (NCU), where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and later pursued a Master's degree in Computer Science.
During my undergraduate studies at NCU, I worked in Dr. Denise Wu’s laboratory, combining mathematical statistics to contribute to research on neuroscience and cognition. This interdisciplinary experience laid a strong foundation for my future endeavors. In graduate school, I was a member of Dr. Fu-Hau Hsu’s Advanced Defense Laboratory [ADL](https://adl.tw/faculty), further deepening my expertise and engagement in cutting-edge research.
